## Was Ist Das?

This is the start of a frontend app for the new Bored Board to use

It's written in Typescript and shouts to the supporting team:

* Yarn
* React
* Docker
* Sass

## Local Dev Sans Docker (EXPERT MODE)

First download all the dependencies by running:

```bash
$ yarn
```

then to develop locally run:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

If everything is hunky dorky, you now have an environment at http://localhost:8080 ready for work with hot-reloading enabled.

For a production build all you have to run is

```bash
$ yarn build
```

## Docker Docker Docker (Moby wasn't in Flipper)

* Ensure you have Docker installed
* `docker-compose up` from root

Everything should come up, you should have an environment at http://localhost:9999
