Here we go again

## Was Ist Das?

This is the start of a frontend app for the new Bored Board to use

It's written in Typescript and shouts to the supporting team:

* Yarn
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* Docker
* Sass

## Local Dev Sans Docker (EXPERT MODE)

First download all the dependencies by running:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn global add webpack@^4.15.1
$ yarn global add webpack-cli
```

then to develop locally run:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

If everything is hunky dorky, you now have an environment at http://localhost:8090 ready for work with hot-reloading enabled.

For a production build all you have to run is

```bash
$ yarn build
```
